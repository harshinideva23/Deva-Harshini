This repository contains a simple language learning game implemented with HTML, JavaScript, and Python using the Flask framework. To run the game locally, ensure you have Python and Flask installed. Start the Flask development server by executing the command python learn.py in the terminal or command prompt. The server will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your web browser to access the game interface. The game involves user registration, login, and interactive language exercises. Follow the on-screen instructions, and use the provided questions to practice language skills. Note that this is a basic educational example, and in a production environment, additional security measures, error handling, and a database for persistent user data would be implemented. For any issues or questions, refer to the comments in the code or contact the repository owner.
